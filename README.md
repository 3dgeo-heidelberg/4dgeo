# 4dGeo

4dGeo is a modular web-based dashboard application for visualizing geospatial data over time. Built with React, it enables users to interact with and analyze 4D geodata (spatial and temporal) using various visualization modules. The project is designed to be flexible and extendable, making it easy to adapt for different use cases such as landslide detection, insect monitoring, and other environmental observations.


## Features

- **Modular Design** - Easily add and customize visualization modules.
- **Customizable Layout** - Configure the dashboard according to specific project needs.


## Data Model

4dGeo utilizes a structured data model to visualize geospatial and temporal data. The model is designed around observations, where each observation represents a snapshot of an area with detected geoobjects and their properties at a specific point in time.

### JSON Structure
```

    ]
}

### Explanation
- **Observations** - A list where each element represents a singular observation.
- **startDateTime & endDateTime** - The time range of the observation.
- **geoObjects** - A list for every Object inside each observation.
    - **type** - Custom Type for your use case.
    - **datetime** - specific point in time, inside the defined time range.
    - **geometry** - Geometrydata for visualising with the 2D View Module.
        - **type** - Type of geometry, like Point and Polygon.
        - **coordinates** - The Coordinates of an Object in reference to the background image.
- **backgroundImageData** - Image source for the background Image of the 2D View Module.
